This was the 

# first major project 

I ever took two years ago and I am really proud of it even if looking at it now makes me feel like this looks like a five minutes work..

# What it does?
1. It asks for your monthly income.
2. It takes your monthly savings.
3. It asks for the amount of things you've purchased in the month and then ask the name along with the cost for each purchase.
4. It calculates how much have you spent(purchase+savings).
5. It decides if you have spent more than you've earned and then gives the extra amount as well as a small message asking to save (with a please in it).
6. It exits ..irony is it wont print all those names you spent minutes entering, ANYWHERE! there is no way of seeing those names again unless you edit the code


# Why is this a git repo if it is soo useless?


## Because I tend to loose a lot of files and I want to safeguard this one by storing it online.
### Also because I want something to spend my time sometimes by using basic java because I dont want to forget the syntax , so I will create branches and add stuffs which I would've added  to it if I had taken up this project now.
